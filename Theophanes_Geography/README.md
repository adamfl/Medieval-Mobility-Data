**Welcome to the Theophanes Geography Project.**

Currently this repository is simply for project members to upload archive copies of our ongoing "Year over Place" master file. 
Project members: this should take place EVERY WEEK.

For a general overview of our project, see [here](http://travelerslab.research.wesleyan.edu/geography-and-narrative-in-the-chronicle-of-theophanes/)

For specific discussion of our process and method, see [here] (http://travelerslab.research.wesleyan.edu/tag/narrative-and-geography/)

As far as our current ongoing work, there are currently two branches of this project, hosted on Google Drive. 

Project members can access the (Drive) folder for the MaxQDA-based geography project here:
